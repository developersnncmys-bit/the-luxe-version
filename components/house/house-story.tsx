            The Luxe Version began the way most quiet things do — with a single piece,
            made carefully, that other rooms wanted. A chandelier, blown by hand, hung
            over the studio's own dining table. Then a lamp. Then a mirror. Then a form
            in bronze that did not need explaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            We opened the house because there was no place we wanted to buy these
            pieces from. The luxury stores were noisy. The design shops were dense. Both
            were full of things that had never been asked to earn their room.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the house was built on a different measure — fewer pieces, more time,
            makers we know. Objects chosen not for what they say about a room, but for
            what they let the room say back.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is the house's introduction. The pieces themselves live in the
            collection. When you are ready, they are waiting.
